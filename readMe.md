Sociology is the study of **social behavior or society** , including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. Like sociology, psychology, economics, history, demography are **all related to the study of society and human activities**. In this way they share similarities.

The differences lie in the follows:

- **Psychology** is the study of **human behavior and mind** , embracing all aspects of conscious and unconscious experience as well as thought of the human beings.
- **Economics** focuses on the **behavior and interactions of economic agents** and how economies work, that is the economic activities of the human kind.
- **History** is the study of the **past events** as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events, particularly **how it relates to humans**.
- **Demography** is the **statistical study of populations, especially human beings**. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that **changes over time or space**.

**Teaching suggestion** :

**You can refer to the following textbooks:**

John J. Macionis &amp; Nijole V. Benokraitis ed., _Seeing Ourselves_ _7__th_ _ed._ (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2007)

James M. Henslin ed., _Down to Earth Sociology: Introductory Readings 14__th_ _ed._ (New York: Free Press, 2007)

(4) (open)

**Teaching suggestion** :

You can refer to the last two parts of the text: &quot;What Work Do Sociologists Do&quot; and &quot;How is Sociology Useful to Me and to the World&quot; (paragraph 19-26) for positive reasons.

Negative reasons vary (why not choose a career related to sociology), for instance, no interest (in social sciences), character reasons (not cut out for dealing with people), and practical reason (no high pay).

### Critical Reading

**I. Understanding the text**

| Part | Para(s). | Main idea |
| --- | --- | --- |

**2.**

(1) To emphasize the importance of sociology and arouse readers&#39; interest in (studying) sociology.

(2) The intended audience of the essay are university and college students. The audience is young and curious about everything but needs some guide in choosing their courses in university study.

(3) In Para. 7, Cargan and Ballantine try to demonstrate that sociology is based on systematic and objective study of human behavior.

(4) They illustrate the difference between individual explanation and group explanation using divorce as an example. Individual explanation considers a divorce as a personal problem caused by conflict between the husband and wife within the family. Sociology can help us move beyond &quot;individual&quot; explanations to consider the social surroundings that influence the situation: economic conditions, disruptions caused by changing sex roles, and pressures on the family to meet the emotional needs of its members.

(5) We can see that the first list of skills (sociology trains us in) is broader and more general category, and the second list of skills (employers look for) is the overlapping or subcategory of the former list. So we can simply put the skills of the second list into its respective categories in the first list (actually, some of the skills in the second list can be put into two or more general categories in the first list). **Note: this is only one way of reorganize the two lists, and not necessarily the best one.**

- Ability to view the world more objectively: ability to plan effectively; self-confidence about job responsibilities; ability to listen to others; self-motivation; effective leadership skills
- Tools to solve problems by designing studies, collecting data, and analyzing results: ability to organize thoughts and information; ability to conceptualize problems clearly
- Ability to understand group dynamics: ability to work with peers; self-motivation; ability to interact effectively in group situations; ability to listen to others
- Ability to understand and evaluate problems: effective problem-solving skills; effective leadership skills;
- Ability to understand your personal problems in a broader social context:        willingness to adapt to the needs of the organization; ability to handle pressure

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1) Yes. The title is a question to the key issue of sociology, which is very clear and focused. And the text provides and elaborates the answers to the key question &quot;why study sociology&quot;.

(2) The introduction is very effective. It starts with six questions about sociology to arouse the readers&#39; interest or curiosity in this topic.

(3) Subtitles in the text are effective and necessary in dividing the text into different but related parts so that the readers can have a clear structural framework about the organization of the text.

(4) The benefits of taking sociology described in Para. 13 are grouped into a general list of five abilities/skills in paragraph 14 and 12 skills in paragraph 15. It is not necessary to use examples to illustrate every benefit mentioned in a long list. However, if the authors added some statistics to support the five categories, the argument would be more convincing.

(5) The conclusion or statement that &quot;sociology is the broadest of the social sciences&quot; is reasonable. Cargan and Ballantine described the wide range of areas sociology covers, and other related disciplines that sociology overlaps with, such as social psychology, political socioloty, anthropology, and social history.

(6) Sociology not only covers vast areas of social studies, but also provides objective perspective and scientific methods in understanding the society and individuals. It also trains us in necessary life and work ability or skills in correctly dealing with issues and problems. In a word, sociology offers us a platform for critical thinking.

(7) Sociologists probe into a social phenomenon/problem with scientific methods (group explanation instead of personal/individual one) that the next unit is to discuss in details (they include experiment, survey, participant observation/field work, and available data analysis).

(8) Structural functionalism, or simply functionalism, is a framework for building theory that sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. This approach looks at society through a macro-level orientation, which is a broad focus on the social structures that shape society as a whole, and believes that society has evolved like organisms. This approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements, namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions.

- Conflict theories are perspectives in sociology and social psychology that emphasize the social, political, or material inequality of a social group, that critique the broad socio-political system, or that otherwise detract from structural functionalism and ideological conservatism. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society. Karl Marx is the father of the social conflict theory, which is a component of the four paradigms of sociology.
- Symbolic interactionism is a sociological perspective which developed around the middle of the twentieth century and that continues to be influential in some areas of the discipline. It is particularly important in microsociology and social psychology. Symbolic interactionism is derived from the American philosophy of pragmatism and particularly from the work of George Herbert Mead who coined the term and put forward an influential summary: people act toward things based on the meaning those things have for them, and these meanings are derived from social interaction and modified through interpretation.
- Utilitarianism is a theory in normative ethics holding that the best moral action is the one that maximizes utility. Utility is defined in various ways, but is usually related to the well-being of sentient entities. Originally, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of Utilitarianism, defined utility as the aggregate pleasure after deducting suffering of all involved in any action. John Stuart Mill expanded this concept of utility to include not only the quantity, but quality of pleasure, while focusing on rules, instead of individual moral actions.

社会学家们的不同兴趣促使他们研究许多不同的领域。有些社会学家精于社会心理学，该领域研究的问题包括：个人在群组中的行为，谁是领导人物，什么类型的领导效果好，为何有些群组比别的群组效率高，为何个人通常会随大流，以及许多涉及个人作为群组成员的作用和行为问题。社会学的另一个专业领域是政治社会学，它研究政治权力，投票行为，官僚制度，以及个人与群组的政治行为。人类学则审视不同族群的文化；社会学也如此。但是两者所采用的研究方法和研究重点有所不同。人类学家通常研究原始族群，而社会学家则主要聚焦于现代族群。涉及社会学的另一个领域是社会史，它强调通过历史来理解社会情境。以上所述仅仅是社会学家广泛研究兴趣的几个例子，也说明社会学是如何与其他社会科学共享研究兴趣的。

**Hawthorne effect:** The Hawthorne effect (also referred to as the observer effect) is a type of reactivity in which individuals modify or improve an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed. The original research at the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois, on lighting changes and work structure changes such as working hours and break times were originally interpreted by Elton Mayo and others to mean that paying attention to overall worker needs would improve productivity. This interpretation was dubbed &quot;the Hawthorne effect&quot;.

1. (1)&quot;common sense&quot;:Common sense is a basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge things, which is shared by (&quot;common to&quot;) nearly all people and can reasonably be expected of nearly all people without any need for debate. However, many of the common sense beliefs are actually lacking in support from scientific evidences and therefore biased and prejudiced.
2. (2)Ordinary people often define their reality and what they know through authoritative opinions, traditional beliefs, personal experience, and mysticism (superstition). The major differences between this kind of &quot;common sense&quot; view knowledge and the results/facts identified through scientific methods are: the former are not based on logical reasoning and hard evidences and therefore tend to be subjective and biased while the latter are just opposite.
3. (3)The three major components of the scientific method are theory, operationalization, and observation. Theory provides the foundation for concepts so that statements about the relationship among variables can be created. Operationalization allows for the measurement of the variables so that they may be empirically examined. And observation involves the actual collection of data to test the hypothesis.

The potential for error and distortion means that &quot;what you see may not be what you get.&quot; |

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

1. (1)An **authority** is a specialist in certain field of knowledge therefore an authority, specialized knowledge from an authority is closer to &quot;truth&quot;, but he is not a knowing-all figure, and he might also be biased in his attitude toward some issues. A **tradition** is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. They are followed by and considered right by certain group of people, but cannot applied to other groups who have their own tradition; and since they are formed and passed down from the past, they might not be applicable to the present world. **Religions** may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that have the side purpose of explaining the origin of life, the Universe, and other things. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. However, religious beliefs mostly lack in empirical or scientific proof. **Personal experience** is based on one&#39;s real life and reality and therefore closer to &quot;reality&quot;, but it is based on an individual&#39;s encounter and perspective on reality, and cannot totally represent the common experience shared by a group of people. **Mysticism** is popularly known as becoming one with God or the Absolute, but may refer to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness which is given a religious or spiritual meaning. It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences. But it is based on religion or superstition, even farther away from being objective and scientific.
2. (2)Since sociologists base their research and conclusion on empirical study with scientific method, it is similar to the disciplines of natural science, but there are two factors that differentiate it from natural sciences. The object of study is human being who can be very complicated and change with time. Also the sociologists are also human beings who can be subjective or even biased in their study. In this sense, sociology is still not equal to natural science in objectivity.
3. (3)The **hypothesis** f the Stanford prison experiment is that change of roles or environment **causes** change of human behavior ( **effect** ). The **independent variable** is the two roles （prisoner and prison guard） assigned to the 24 students who are all randomly selected ( **sampling** ) from among the university students, and the dependent variable is their (change of) behavior.
4. (4)First, experiments are often not possible because they would expose subjects to the possibility of harm. For example, what if a researcher wanted to know whether people who were abused as children are more likely to abuse their children? Second, the subjects often behave differently when they are under scientific observation from the way they would in their normal environment. Third, laboratory experiments are often highly artificial. When researchers try to set up social situations in laboratories, they often must omit many of the factors that would influence the same behavior in a real-life situation, thus affecting the validity of the experiment result.
5. (5)The merits of survey through the Internet are that it&#39;s very quick (in terms of time)  and efficient (in terms of cost), but the drawbacks are also obvious: not all citizens use the Internet (and therefore excluded from the sampling), and also not all netizens participate in the survey and therefore further affect the survey result.
6. (6)The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. Accuracy in big data may lead to more confident decision making, and better decisions can result in greater operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk. Relational database management systems and desktop statistics and visualization packages often have difficulty handling big data. The work instead requires &quot;massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers&quot;. Also, those who do not use the Internet are excluded from the analysis therefore affect the analysis and conclusion.
7. (7)(This question is open for discussion and there&#39;s no definite answer) The Internet companies are caught between the two sides: the government side who emphasize gathering monitoring information for public security or national security reason, and the netizens who defend their right of &quot;privacy&quot;. Laws should be made regarding the right and responsibility of each side.
8. (8)(This question is open for discussion) How one feels about these statistical figures might be affected by the class, occupation, gender, region and age group (and other factors) an individual belongs to. And also, the official statistics might not be very accurate.
9. (9)(This question is open for discussion) Obviously, mass media (newspapers, radio, TV, the Internet) are the major channel people get most of their information which is supposed to be true and real. But there are some factors that influence the so-called truth: ownership (private or public), editors&#39; stance, class background of the participants (in the Internet) can all influence the information we get from the mass media.

**Posture:** In humans, posture can provide a significant amount of important information on nonverbal communication and emotional cues. Psychological studies have shown the effects of body posture on emotions. Currently, many studies have shown that certain patterns of body movements are indicative of specific emotions. Researchers studied sign language and found that even non-sign language users can determine emotions from only hand movements.

**Gesture:** Gesture is a form of non-verbal communication or non-vocal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Gestures allow individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in addition to words when they speak.

**Facial expression:** A facial expression is one or more motions or positions of the muscles beneath the skin of the face. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social information between humans. The eyes are often viewed as important features of facial expressions. Aspects such as blinking rate can be used to indicate whether or not a person is nervous or whether or not he or she is lying. Also, eye contact is considered an important aspect of interpersonal communication.

**Eye contact:** Eye contact occurs when two people look at each other&#39;s eyes at the same time. In human beings, eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication and is thought to have a large influence on social behavior. Coined in the early to mid-1960s, the term came from the West to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of confidence, respect, and social communication. The customs and significance of eye contact vary between societies, with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.

**Spatial bubble:** It refers to personal boundaries. They are guidelines, rules or limits that a person creates to identify for themselves what are reasonable, safe and permissible ways for other people to behave towards him or her and how they will respond when someone steps past those limits. According to some in the counseling profession, personal boundaries help to define an individual by outlining likes and dislikes, and setting the distances one allows others to approach.

Paul Ekman (born February 15, 1934) is an American psychologist who is a pioneer in the study of emotions and their relation to facial expressions. He has created an &quot;atlas of emotions&quot; with more than ten thousand facial expressions, and has gained a reputation as &quot;the best human lie detector in the world&quot;. It is related to microexpression – a brief, involuntary facial expression shown on the face of humans according to emotions experienced. They usually occur in high-stakes situations, where people have something to lose or gain. Microexpressions occur when a person is consciously trying to conceal all signs of how they are feeling, or when a person does not consciously know how they are feeling. Microexpressions cannot be controlled as they happen in a fraction of a second, but it&#39;s possible to capture someone&#39;s expressions with a high speed camera and replay them at much slower speeds. Some of Ekman&#39;s important works include _Telling Lies: Clues to Deceit in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage_ (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1985) and _Emotions Revealed: Recognizing Faces and Feelings to Improve Communication and Emotional Life_ (Times Books, 2003).

一个人如何处理约会时的距离明显反映出男人或女人对约会对象的感受指标。初次约会时，如果女方坐的或站的离男方太近以至于男方强烈地感受到她的实体存在—在亲密距离以内—男方通常会将此理解为女方在鼓励他接近。但在男方对女方采取下一步行动之前，他应该确定女方发出的实际信息；否则，他会冒着自尊心受伤的风险。北欧背景的人感到过近的交际距离对于意大利背景的人来说只能算是中等的或较远的距离。还有，女性有时会利用空间距离来误导男人。没有比女人交际时发出的矛盾信息更能阻止男人的事了。例如，女人圈缩着让男人靠近，随后的行为却像是受到了男人的侮辱。

## Unit 4 Organization and Institution

**Text A**

### Preparatory Work

(1)

**a. Institutionalization:** refers to the process of embedding some conception (for example a belief, norm, social role, particular value or mode of behavior) within an organization, social system, or society as a whole. The term may also be used to refer to committing a particular individual or group to an institution, such as a mental or welfare institution.

**b. Solitary confinement:** is a form of imprisonment in which an inmate is isolated from any human contact, often with the exception of members of prison staff. It is mostly employed as a form of punishment beyond incarceration for a prisoner, usually for violations of prison regulations. However, it is also used as an additional measure of protection for vulnerable inmates. In the case prisoners at high risk of suicide, it can be used to prevent access to items that could allow the prisoner to self-harm.

**c. Parole:** is the provisional release of a prisoner who agrees to certain conditions prior to the completion of the maximum sentence period. A specific type of parole is medical parole or compassionate release which is the release of prisoners on medical or humanitarian grounds. Conditions of parole often include things such as obeying the law, refraining from drug and alcohol use, avoiding contact with the parolee&#39;s victims, obtaining employment, and maintaining required contacts with a parole officer.

**d. Rehabilitation:** is the re-integration into society of a convicted person and the main objective of modern penal policy, to counter habitual offending, also known as criminal recidivism. Alternatives to imprisonment also exist, such as community service, probation orders, and others entailing guidance and aftercare towards the offender.

| Name of experiment | Description of the experiment | Relation of the experiment with the text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experiment on obedience | A series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience; the experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of people were prepared to obey, albeit unwillingly, even if apparently causing serious injury and distress. | Closely related with the text since they are all about the effect of assigned roles. |
| Small-world experiment (six degrees of separation) | The small-world experiment comprised several experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram and other researchers examining the average path length for social networks of people in the United States. The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a small-world-type network characterized by short path-lengths. The experiments are often associated with the phrase &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;, although Milgram did not use this term himself. | Not closely related with the text since the experiment is about social networking between individuals in the United States. |

### Critical Reading

**I. Understanding the text**

1.

| Part | Para(s) | Main idea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I. Anecdote and introduction | 1-2 | A case showing the necessity for prison reform |
| II. Body | 3-10 (the experiment) | The experiment of a mock prison with guards and prisoners were carried out and had to end earlier because of the frightening effect. |
| III. Findings | 11-13 (implication) | Individual behavior is largely under the control of social forces and environmental contingencies rather than personality traits, character, willpower, or other empirically un-validated constructs. |
| IV. Conclusion | 14 (effects of prison) | The prison situation is guaranteed to generate severe pathological reactions in both guards and prisoners as to debase their humanity, and make it difficult for them to be part of a society outside of their prison. |

2.

(1)Zimbardo uses the specific example of a prisoner&#39;s situation to plead for prison reform and to justify the experiment he conducted about the bad effect of prison.
(2)They conduct an experiment about the effects of prison on both guards and prisoners.
(3)They want to understand what it means psychologically to be a prisoner or a prison guard.
(4)The 24 participants are selected randomly from volunteer students in Palo Alto city and they were randomly assigned roles of guards and prisoners in a simulated prison.
(5)At Stanford University in 1971.
(6)The experiment has to be ended earlier than planned.
(7)Because the effects of prison (abusing and being abused) on those being experimented are frightening.
(8)The results show that people underestimate the power and pervasiveness of situational controls over behavior.
(9)Individual behavior is largely under the control of social forces and environmental contingencies rather than personality traits, character, willpower, etc. Many people, perhaps the majority, can be made to do almost anything when put into psychologically compelling situations – regardless of their morals, ethics, values, attitudes, beliefs, or personal convictions.

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1)

**Hypothesis:** the change of environment (including changed roles) affects one&#39;s behavior (students are put into a mock prison and assigned opposite roles which are all different from their normal environment and role of being a student or citizen)

**Cause:** prison and assigned new roles (changed environment)

**Effect:** rational people with humanity were turned to abusers and victims

**Independent variable:** the participants as human beings (the same human beings)

( **Stimulus:** change of environment/roles)

**Dependent variable:** behavior

The experiment on the power and influence of roles assigned to ordinary individualsis basically valid and convincing, and similar experiments also prove that most people&#39;s behavior are influenced by the social environment, particularly the new roles they are assigned. Unfortunately, the experiment cannot be confirmed due to the ethical concern (the harm caused by the experiment on the participants). And also, since the participants of a social experiment are humans, the result might not be exactly the same (unlike the natural science experiment which can be repeated with precision and same result).

(2)

**Similarities:** the two experiments are all about the effect of assigned roles and social expectations on the behavior of the human beings.

**Differences:** Zimbardo&#39;s experiment focuses on the gradual change of behavior on those who are assigned new roles (prison effect) while Stanley&#39;s experiment focuses on authority&#39;s influence on individuals in normal circumstances (authority effect).

(3)

Power and its execution are closely related with the role assigned to the power-holder. The more important role he/she is given, the more likely he/she abuses it if there are no checks and balances from other institutions. It is very important to fight against corruption (in campaigns or through legal means), but it&#39;s more important to set up mechanism to balance the role given to power-holders.

(4)

Zimbardo&#39;s statement or conclusion is based on his only experiment about humans and their environment and cannot be repeated due to ethical reasons. It is reasonable to argue that most people are influenced by the (change of) environment and adapt to it quickly, which means personal &quot;freedom&quot; is conditioned. However, there are exceptions, and this statement cannot explain the behavior of those heroes who stick to their principles under any circumstances and would rather die than surrender to enemy or power.

(5)

These exceptional examples are mostly heroes in extreme circumstances such as war or condition of life and death (Wen Tianxiang, Liu Hulan, John Brown etc.). They have to choose between life and death very quickly and sometimes they act from instinct. There are other factors that result in these exceptional cases – they all have very strong characters which have been fostered in hardship; they also have a very strong faith and are ready to die for the cause they pursue.

(6)

Besides the reason Zimbardo mentions (psychological factor of self-image for the donors), there are at least two more reasons. One is religious reason – most people in the West are Christians who believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ and feel a duty to help the poor (in the form of material, money, or time). The other is related to the affluence of the West where the majority of people become well-off enough to give away a fraction of their wealth or money to maintain social stability. (There&#39;re also other reasons such as tax deduction in some countries to encourage donation.)

(7)

Simply put, the merit of &quot;group think&quot; is that it can mobilize a uniformed collective force to realize some goal that individuals alone cannot hope to accomplish (through teamwork and national solidarity). The demerit of &quot;group think&quot; is that the group leader&#39;s view might be one-sided and flawed, and the wrong decision or policy based on it could easily lead to mistakes or even disaster. Other demerits: this situation may easily result in the circumstance of strong leader/dictator vs. obedient/populist followers; and in many cases the &quot;truth&quot; is not necessary in the hands of the majority. (8)

Clinical trials are experiments done in clinical research. Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on **human participants** are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on safety and efficacy. They are conducted only after they have received **health authority/ethics committee approval** in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial - their approval does not mean that the therapy is &#39;safe&#39; or effective, only that the trial may be conducted. Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll **volunteers and/or patients** into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. The key point here is: All participants are volunteers who choose clinical trial when other means fail.

Worldwide it is estimated that the number of vertebrate animals ranges from the tens of millions to more than 100 million used in animal experiment annually. In the EU, these species represent 93% of animals used in research. If the same was true in the US then the total number of animals used in research is estimated to be between 12 and 25 million. Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment. Animal rights, and some animal welfare, organizations question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.

## Unit 6 Poverty and Work

Text A

### Preparatory Work

(1)

**Research field:** urban renewal and its problems, immigrants and community, national news media study.

**Major publications:** His first book, _The Urban Villagers_ (1962), described Boston&#39;s diverse West End neighborhood, where he mainly studied its Italian-American working class community. His 1967 book _The Levittowners_ was based on several years of participant-observation in New Jersey&#39;s Levitt-built suburb in Willingboro, observing how a set of new homeowners came together to establish the community&#39;s formal and informal organizations. He has published several studies of the news media and the entertainment media, the best known being _Popular Culture and High Culture_ (1974, 1999). In it, he challenged the conventional wisdom that high culture aesthetic standards were universal, arguing instead that cultural tastes reflect educational levels and other aspects of class. In his writings on poverty, Gans offered rigorous, often scathing criticism of the weaknesses of such concepts as &quot;the culture of poverty,&quot; and the &quot;underclass,&quot; most notably in _The War Against the Poor_ (1995).

(2)

**Unintended consequences:** In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences) are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularized in the twentieth century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton. Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types: unexpected benefit, unexpected drawback, and perverse result (&quot;backfire&quot;).

**Reference group:** A reference group is a group to which an individual or another group is compared. Sociologists call any group that individuals use as a standard for evaluating themselves and their own behavior a reference group. Reference groups are used in order to evaluate and determine the nature of a given individual or other group&#39;s characteristics and sociological attributes. Robert K. Merton hypothesized that individuals compare themselves with reference groups of people who occupy the social role to which the individual aspires. Reference groups act as a frame of reference to which people always refer to evaluate their achievements, their role performance, aspirations and ambitions.

**Role model:** A role model is a person whose behavior, example, or success is or can be emulated by others, especially by younger people. The term &quot;role model&quot; is credited to sociologist Robert K. Merton, who coined the phrase during his career. Merton hypothesized that individuals compare themselves with reference groups of people who occupy the social role to which the individual aspires. An example being the way fans (oftentimes youth) will idolize and imitate professional athletes or entertainment artists.

**Self-fulfilling prophecy:** A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to positive feedback between belief and behavior. Robert K. Merton is credited with coining the expression &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article _Self-Fulfilling Prophecy_, Merton defines it in the following terms:&quot;The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come true. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.&quot; Self-fulfilling prophecy are effects in behavioral confirmation effect, in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true. It is complementary to the self-defeating prophecy.

**Manifest function and Latent function:** Manifest and latent functions are social scientific concepts first clarified for sociology by Robert K. Merton. Merton appeared interested in sharpening the conceptual tools to be employed in a functional analysis. Manifest functions are conscious, deliberate and beneficial, the latent ones the unconscious, unintended and beneficial, and dysfunctions are unconscious, unintended and harmful. Latent functions are those that are neither recognized nor intended. A latent function of a behavior is not explicitly stated, recognized, or intended by the people involved.

(3)

**Poverty:** Poverty is general scarcity, dearth, or the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money. It is a multifaceted concept, which includes social, economic, and political elements. Poverty may be defined as either absolute or relative. Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the lack of means necessary to meet basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter. Relative poverty takes into consideration individual social and economic status compared to the rest of society.

**Nouveau riche:** Nouveau riche (French: &#39;new rich&#39;) is a term, usually derogatory, to describe those whose wealth has been acquired within their own generation, rather than by familial inheritance. The equivalent English term is the &quot;new rich&quot; or &quot;new money&quot; (in contrast with &quot;old money&quot;). Sociologically, nouveau riche refers to the man or woman who previously had belonged to a lower social class and economic stratum (rank) within that class; and that the new money—which constitutes his or her wealth—allowed upward social mobility and provided the means for conspicuous consumption, the buying of goods and services that signal membership in an upper class.

**Hierarchy:** A hierarchyis an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being &quot;above,&quot; &quot;below,&quot; or &quot;at the same level as&quot; one another. In sociology, it often refers to the hierarchical class system caused by social stratification.

**Affluence:** Affluence refers to a state where one is rich enough to buy things for pleasure. It often refers to the 1950s and 1960s where most people in Western Europe and the United States were getting well-off.

**Social mobility:** Social mobility is the movement of individuals, families, households, or other categories of people within or between social strata in a society. It is a change in social status relative to others&#39; social location within a given society. While most social mobility is upward in Western countries some is downward.

**Laissez-faire:** Laissez-faire is an economic system in which transactions between private parties are free from government interference such as regulations, privileges, tariffs, and subsidies. The phrase laissez-faire is part of a larger French phrase and literally translates to &quot;let (it/them) do&quot;, but in this context usually means to &quot;let go&quot;.

**Charity:** The practice of charity means the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a humanitarian act.A charitable organization is a type of non-profit organization (NPO). It differs from other types of NPOs in that it centers on philanthropic goals as well as social well-being (e.g. charitable, educational, religious, or other activities serving the public interest or common good).

(4)

**Employment（就业、雇佣）:** Employment is a relationship between two parties, usually based on a contract where work is paid for, where one party, which may be a corporation, for profit, not-for-profit organization, co-operative or other entity is the employer and the other is the employee. Employees work in return for payment, which may be in the form of an hourly wage, by piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does and/or which sector she or he is working in. Employment is typically governed by employment laws or regulations and/or legal contracts.

**Work（工作）:** Work refers to a job that someone is paid to do. It involves the socioeconomic relationship between a worker and an employer, where the worker sells their labour under a formal or informal employment contract. These transactions usually occur in a labour market where wages are market determined.

**Occupation（职业）** : = job. This word is used especially on forms and in formal writing.

**Profession（职业、专业）:** A profession is a vocation founded upon specialized educational training, the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain. &quot;Liberal professions&quot; are, according to the European Union&#39;s Directive on Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) &quot;those practiced on the basis of relevant professional qualifications in a personal, responsible and professionally independent capacity by those providing intellectual and conceptual services in the interest of the client and the public&quot;.

**Career（生涯、事业、职业）:** A career is an individual&#39;s journey through learning, work and other aspects of life. There are a number of ways to define a career and the term is used in a variety of ways.The word career is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a person&#39;s &quot;course or progress through life (or a distinct portion of life)&quot;. In this definition career is understood to relate to a range of aspects of an individual&#39;s life, learning and work. Career is also frequently understood to relate to the working aspects of an individual&#39;s life e.g. as in career woman. A third way in which the term career is used is to describe an occupation or a profession that usually involves special training or formal education, and is considered to be a person&#39;s lifework. In this case &quot;a career&quot; is seen as a sequence of related jobs usually pursued within a single industry or sector e.g. &quot;a career in education&quot; or &quot;a career in the building trade&quot;.

| Positive Function | Example (You can use examples outside the text) |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Poverty ensures that a society&#39;s &quot;dirty work&quot; will be done. | Low-paid dirty jobs such as cleaning and garbage collecting are all done by the poor. |
| 2. It subsidizes a variety of economic activities that benefit the affluent. | Baby-sitters can liberate career women or housewives for other interesting activities.   |
| 3. It creates jobs to serve or &quot;service&quot; the poor, or protect the rest of the society from them | The police and the prostitutes are good examples.   |
| 4. It prolongs the economic usefulness of the goods that others do not want. | The poor have to buy day-old bread, secondhand clothes, and deteriorating automobiles. |
| 5. The poor serve as &quot;deviants&quot; to uphold the legitimacy of conventional norms. | The poor are often accused of being lazy, spendthrift, dishonest, and promiscuous in contrast to the middle class values of the opposite. |
| 6. The poor participate in the uninhibited sexual, alcoholic and narcotic behavior for the rest of population who is more &quot;decent&quot;. | It is believed that the poor derive more pleasure from sex and drugs than the middle class. |
| 7. The poor serve as a direct cultural function when culture created by or for them is adopted by the more affluent. | Blues, country music, rock and roll are good examples. |
| 8. Poverty helps to guarantee the status of those who are not poor. | Working class identity vs the poor |
| 9. The poor aids the upward mobility of groups just above them in the class hierarchy. | Some groups moved upward by making money from the poor (house renting, drug selling etc. in the slums) |
| 10. The poor help keep the aristocracy busy and justify its continued existence. | Settlement houses and charity affairs (sponsored by the super- rich people or aristocracy) |
| 11. The poor can be made to absorb the costs of change and growth in American society. | They have helped to build cites but were pushed out their neighborhood to make room for &quot;progress&quot; in urban renewal projects. |
| 12. The poor facilitate and stabilize the American political process. | They often provide the Democrats with a captive constituency （铁杆选民） that has no other place to go. |
| 13. The role of poor has a significant political function to justify the ideology of the laissez-faire capitalist economy. | It is alleged that the poor remain poor because they are unwilling to work. Or they are inferior because they accept charity or welfare to survive. |

(1)Merton defines functions as &quot;those observed consequences (of a phenomenon) which make for the adaptation or adjustment of a given (social) system.&quot; Instead of identifying functions for an entire social system, Gans identifies them for the interest groups, socio-economic classes, and other population aggregates with share values that &quot;inhabit&quot; a social system.
(2)According to Gans, functions result in benefits while dysfunctions (negative functions) result in cost. However, he argues that few phenomena are functional or dysfunctional for the society as a whole, and that most functions result in benefits to some groups and costs to others.
(3)Gans lists a number of functional alternatives for poverty, here are the major ones: Society&#39;s dirty work would be done without poverty, either by automation or by paying &quot;dirty workers&#39; decent wages. Nor is it necessary for the poor to subsidize the many activities they support through their low-wage jobs. Similarly, many of the professionals who flourish because of the poor could be given other roles. But this would drive up the costs and prices.
(4)Many of the functions served by the poor could be replaced if poverty were eliminated, but almost always at higher costs to others, particularly more affluent others.
(5)With increased affluence the poor would probably obtain more political power and be more active politically. With higher incomes and more political power, the poor would be likely to resist paying the costs of growth and change.
(6)Social phenomena that are functional for affluent or powerful groups and dysfunctional for poor or powerless ones persist. When the elimination of such phenomena through functional alternatives would generate dysfunctions for the affluent or powerful, they will continue to persist. Phenomena like poverty can be eliminated only when they become dysfunctional for the affluent or powerful, or when the powerless can obtain enough power to change society.
(7)Gans uses the postscript to clarify some misunderstandings on his views on poverty in this article after its initial publication and defend functionalism for its merits. Gans points out his view on poverty very clearly: first and foremost, there are positive functions of poverty which have to be dealt with by antipoverty policy; second, he is trying to show that functionalism is not the inherently conservative approach often criticized, but that it can be employed in liberal and radical analyses.

| 1 | The existence of povertyensures that society&#39;s &quot;dirtywork&quot; will be done. | (no definite answers and open for discussion) |
| 2 | The poor&#39;s working at low wages subsidizes a variety of economic activities that benefit the affluent. |   |
| 3 | Poverty creates jobs for a number of occupations and professions that serve or &quot;service&quot; the poor, or protect the rest of society from them. |   |
| 4 | The poor buy goods others do not want and thus prolong the economic usefulness of such goods. |   |
| 5 | The poor can be identified and punished as alleged or real deviants in order to uphold the legitimacy of conventional norms. |   |
| 6 | The poor offer vicarious participation to the rest of the population in the uninhibited sexual, alcoholic, and narcotic behavior in which they are alleged to participate. |   |

The original title &quot;No, Poverty Has Not Disappeared&quot; is not as sharp and to the point as the present title &quot;The Use of Poverty: the Poor Pay All&quot; which highlights the function and nature of poverty, that is, the poor pay all in American society.

(3)

Suggestion: explore the issue from two different theories.

Functionalism explains poverty as the result of the poor being lazy or lacking marketable skills needed in the capitalist market while conflict theory (Marxism) argues that poverty is the result of structured inequality in the capitalist socio-economic system.

(4)

Tentative alternative argument:

Since the well-off (middle class) and rich people pay higher proportion of their income as tax (which is much more than the income of the poor either in proportion or in absolute number), it&#39;s the middle class and the rich people in America who sacrifice their interest to maintain social stability, and the poor benefit from this system.

(5)

This accusation is not fair. People only notice the obvious crime in the street (theft and robbery etc.) but tend to ignore the white-collar crime (e.g. embezzlement) in the well-off class and corporate corruption (such as the case of financial crisis where the bankers who enjoy high salary and bonus ruined the American economy and brought disaster to the whole nation or even the whole world). Due to their money influence and connection with politicians, they can easily get away with their crimes without being noticed (the media are also influenced by or even owned by them).

(6)

Tentative explanation: the title and key word &quot;function&quot; easily indicate that the author is a functionalist and justifies poverty in American society. That&#39;s why the author tries to clarify his position on poverty that he explores the functions of poverty to arouse readers&#39; attention so that something can be done about it. He never states in the text that poverty is good and should stay.

(7)

Tentative explanation:

Functionalism justifies the inequality of a society (the gap between the rich and the poor) as a result of division of labor and market demand for marketable skills and considers it fair and reasonable. Marxism argues that poverty is the result of the total socio-economic system of capitalism which exploits the poor, thus causes inequality and poverty.

(8)

Tentative explanation:

Functionalist theory cannot fully explain China&#39;s poverty problem. It is true that poverty in China was largely caused by the poor&#39;s low level of education and lack of marketable skills in the market, it might also have been caused by other factors such as poor environment and lack of resources (esp. in Northwest China). Even so, China&#39;s socialist system enjoys a lot of advantages (the biggest one is the resourcefulness of governments of all levels), and over the past decades, China has drastically reduced its poverty population and set the goal of getting rid ofpoverty by 2020 (through the program of accurate poverty alleviation).

将贫困与正面功能相联系乍看似乎不可思议。当然，大家都知道贫民窟的房东和高利贷者从现存的贫困中获利，但是他们被视为邪恶的人因而其行为被列作贫困的负面功能。然而，鲜为人知的，至少鲜为普通人的常识智慧所认识的，是贫困使一些体面高端的职业生存和扩展，例如，监狱管理学、犯罪学、与社会福利有关的工作、以及公共卫生学。近些年来，贫困为专业和半专业的&quot;与贫困做斗争的人&quot;提供了工作，也为新闻工作者与社会科学家，包括本文作者，提供工作，后者为公众对贫困问题兴趣的重现提供其所需要的资讯。

| Part | Paras. | Main idea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I Overall introduction to the thesis and basic concepts | 1-4 | Human relations and the self-image of the human being have been profoundly affected by the Internet. |
| II Friendship and control | 5-12 | Real friendship shows itself in action and affection in reality, but the shift to making friends and maintaining friendship through the Internet is affecting true friendship in a negative way. |

**2.**

1. (1)Human relations, and the self-image of the human being, have been profoundly affected by the Internet and by the ease with which images of other people can be summoned to the computer screen to become the objects of emotional attention.No more need to get up from your desk and make the journey to your friend&#39;s house. No more need for weekly meetings, or the circle of friends in the downtown restaurant or bar. All those effortful ways of making contact can be dispensed with: a touch of the keyboard and you are there, where you wanted to be, on the site that defines your friends.
2. (2)The major difference lies in the speed–the former is rather slow and the latter is almost instant in its delivery. This also causes another difference—we write letters to important people and therefore do it in a careful way while for an email we simply compose it in a hurry and send.
3. (3)Real friendship shows itself in action and affection. The real friend is the one who comes to the rescue in your hour of need; who is there with comfort in adversity and who shares with you his own success. This is hard to do on the screen.
4. (4)It is cost-free, screen-friendly, and very convenient and thus attracts many people to use it, but the users tend to develop obsession about making friends and maintaining friendship through the Facebook and thus might affect their real lives and their real relationships.
5. (5)&quot;Avatars&quot; are virtual characters in virtual worlds created by cyber space users as proxies for themselves; avatars enable those users to live in complete self-complacency behind the screen, exposed to no danger and yet enjoying a kind of substitute affection through the adventures of their cyber-ego.In vesting one&#39;s emotional life in the adventures of an avatar, one retreats completely from real relationships. Instead of being a means to augment relationships that exist outside of it, the Internet could become the sole arena of social life—but an unreal life involving unreal people (a kind of alienation and fetishism).
6. (6)The game _Second Life_ offers a virtual world and invites you to enter it in the form of an avatar constructed from its collection of templates. It has its own currency, in which purchases can be made in its own stores. It rents spaces to avatars as their homes and businesses. Second Life also provides opportunities for &quot;social&quot; action, with social positions achieved by merit—or, at any rate, virtual merit. In this way people can enjoy, through their avatars, cost-free versions of the social emotions, and can become heroes of &quot;compassion,&quot; without lifting a finger in the real world.
7. (7)According to Hegel, we human beings fulfill ourselves through our own free actions, and through the consciousness that these actions bring of our individual worth. But we are not free in a state of nature, nor do we, outside the world of human relations, have the kind of consciousness of self that allows us to value and intend our own fulfillment. Freedom is not reducible to the unhindered choices that even an animal might enjoy; nor is self-consciousness simply a matter of the pleasurable immersion in immediate experiences. Freedom involves an active engagement with the world, in which opposition is encountered and overcome, risks are taken and satisfactions weighed: It is, in short, an exercise of practical reason, in pursuit of goals whose value must justify the efforts needed to obtain them.
8. (8)_Selbstbestimmung_, that is, self-determination or self-certainty.
9. (9)Marx uses fetishism as manifestation of alienation. The consumer in a capitalist society, according to Marx, transfers his life into the commodities that bewitch him, and so loses that life—becoming a slave to commodities precisely through seeing the market in goods rather than the free interactions of people; as the place where his desires are brokered and fulfilled.
10. (10) **&quot;** The realization of the self **&quot;** : the process of raising ourselves above the animal conditionas a self-knowing agent, capable of entertaining and acting from reasons, and with a developed first-person perspective and a sense of his reality as one subject among others. It is a process that depends upon real conflicts and real resolutions, in a shared public space where each of us is fully accountable for what he is and does.  
&quot;The alienation&quot; of the self&quot;: Anything that interferes with that process, by undermining the growth of interpersonal relations, by confiscating responsibility, or by preventing or discouraging an individual from making long-term rational choices and adopting a concrete vision of his own fulfillment.

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1)

**Tentative answer:** Scruton&#39;s argument is reasonable from the perspective of traditional idea about friendwho can meet you in person frequently and provide emotional and/or physical help –&quot;a friend in need is a friend indeed&quot;. However, as we have entered a fast changing era andthe Internet time, it&#39;s increasingly impossible to make friends or maintain friendship in the traditional way. The Email and the Facebook offer a quick means to make friends and maintain friendship. But the drawback is that it is hard to go deep due to lack of face-to-face interaction.

(2)

**Tentative answer:** Scruton&#39;s argument is about &quot;real friend&quot; or close/intimate friend which is very few in any era. In one&#39;s life, one may have different circles of friends whose functions are different and who can meet your different needs, for example, close friend (moral, emotional or even financial support), friend at work (work support), friends who share same hobbies with you such as sports. We need all of them in our life.

(3)

**Tentative criticism:** (Para. 11): (1) One usually uses the Internet mainly as a means of quick and effective communication including making friends and maintaining friendship, not as barrier or control; (2) Even if it serves as a means of control, we can also argue that you are under the same control in the same system; (3) In fact, communication through the Internet may empower you and your counterpart to be more open and challenge each other than the face-to-face interaction. (4) You can still make appointments with your friends if you need to meet them face to face.

(Para. 12): It is true that the Facebook experience might encourage a kind of narcissism (which is actually part of the human nature neglected in the past), but through this display of self, friends can learn more about their friends (strengths and weaknesses) and thereforestrengthentheir bond. Besides, the display of self, and listed others on the website make it easier for peopleto find, make friends and maintain friendship than in the traditional way.

(4)

**Tentative challenge:** It depends on the definition of &quot;real life&quot;. Scruton obviously uses the term as &quot;existing in the physical world, not just in someone&#39;s imagination or stories&quot; (Macmillan English Dictionary 2003). It is true that human life is based on and cannot separate from the physical world, however, imagination and ideas are also inseparable or are even more important part of human life. Interaction in the virtual space has been increasingly becoming important part of one life as computer technologyadvances. We can even argue that &quot;real life&quot; is not complete without the Internet and virtual life, or even &quot;real life&quot; is increasingly becoming &quot;virtual life&quot;.

(5)

**Tentative answer:** These ideas of freedom, self-consciousness, and alienation may also be applied to the virtual world where individuals are self-conscious and have freedom which is conditioned (that is &quot;right comes with duty&quot;). And also, overly depending on the Internet (obsession and addition) may also cause alienation or fetishism which are bad for human&#39;s well-being.

(6)

**Tentative brief answer:** Human beings are complicated features who have many sides in their life, and sometimes &quot;performance&quot; is part of the &quot;real life&quot;. As Shakespeare wisely stated, &quot;All the world&#39;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.&quot; The reality TV programs reveal the unknown part of these celebrities&#39;life (that they want the audience to know to keep their popularity). Its impact on the audience are twofold – the audience learn more about the celebrities or stars to like them or hate them; the fans&#39;obsession about their idols might cause them to imitate (and make their own life videos to be released and shared with netizens).

真正的友谊体现在行动和情感上。真正的朋友会在你切实需要时援手相救；在你遭到挫折时出现在身边给你安慰；在他自己成功时来与你分享。而这很难在电脑屏幕前做到——电脑主要是信息的一个汇聚点，也就勉强算一个行动的地点，如果我们将交流算做行动的一种表现形式。在朋友（受害者）在现实世界受难时，需要抵御敌人的打击时，需要任何有形的实际帮助时，我们在电脑上发出的对他们的安慰只有言词而非实际行动或物质帮助。有一种受到争议的观点认为，人们越是通过网络满足交友的需求，他们就越不可能发展友谊，那种能够在真实生活的考验中提供帮助和安慰的友谊。主要在屏幕上发展起来的友谊也不太可能轻易地脱离屏幕, 而即使这种友谊能够脱离网络时，也不能保证它能经受住任何挫折和考验。的确如此，正是因为互联网的免费与方便特性吸引了许多人使用它，其实用如此普遍以至于我的学生们告诉我，他们害怕上瘾，经常强迫自己一连几天不去查看他们的脸书账户，就是为了能够过真实的生活并维持真实的友情和社会关系。

## Unit 8 Family and Marriage

**Text A**

### Preparatory Work

(1)

**An extended family** is a family that extends beyond the nuclear family, consisting of parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all living nearby or in the same household. In modern Western cultures dominated by immediate family constructs, the term has come to be used generically to refer to grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, whether they live together within the same household or not. However, it may also refer to a family unit in which several generations live together within a single household. In some cultures, the term is used synonymously with consanguineous family.

**A nuclear family** or elementary family is a family group consisting of a pair of adults and their children. It is in contrast to a single-parent family, to the larger extended family, and to a family with more than two parents. Nuclear families typically centre on a married couple; the nuclear family may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers; some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings, but others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children.

**Monogamy**  is the custom or condition of having only one mate. The word monogamy comes from the Greek word monos, which means one or alone, and the Greek word gamos, which means marriage or union. It literally means being married to one person. People currently apply the term monogamy to both married and unmarried couples.

[**Polygamy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy) is the custom or condition of having multiple marriage partners. The word polygamy comes from the Greek word poly, which means many, and the Greek word gamos, which means marriage or union.

**A two-earner family**  (also known asdual-earner family) is one that breaks from the traditional role – where it is expected that the father works outside of the home whilst the mother stays at home taking care of the children.  In dual-earner families, both parents work outside of the home. Dual-earner families (where both partners are formally employed but only one—usually the male—pursues a career) should not be confused with dual-career family, in which both partners pursue occupational [careers](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-career.html). Such marriages are still relatively rare, and findings about dual-career  [families](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-marriage.html) may not generalize to dual-earner families which are now the norm. However, empirical studies suggest that both career women and those with less rewarding jobs appear to work a double shift, combining home and work responsibilities.

**Rorschach blot** (also known as the Rorschach inkblot test, the Rorschach, or simply the inkblot test) is a  [psychological test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_test) in which subjects&#39; perceptions of  [inkblots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink) are recorded and then analyzedusing  [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) interpretation, complex  [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person&#39;s personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying  [thought disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder), especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly. The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist [Hermann Rorschach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Rorschach).

The Adventures of **Ozzie and Harriet:** an American [sitcom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_comedy), airing on [ABC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company) from October 3, 1952 through March 26, 1966, starring the real life of Nelson family. The show strove for realism and focused mainly on the Nelson family at home, dealing with run-of-the-mill problems. Many of the series storylines were taken from the Nelsons&#39; real life. The series attracted large audiences and became synonymous with the 1950s ideal American family life. But by the mid 1960s, America&#39;s social climate was changing, and the Nelsons&#39; all American [nuclear family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_family)that epitomized the 1950s values and ideals quickly became a thing of the past. Having run for a total of fourteen seasons, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet remains the longest-running live-action American television sitcom.

**Victorian family pattern:** Victorian Britain is often considered a model of middle-class society. The family was the central institution of middle-class life. Men provided the family income while women focused on household and child care. The use of domestic servants in many middle-class homes, made possible by an abundant supply of cheap labor, reduced the amount of time middle-class women had to spend on household labor. At the same time, by reducing the number of children in the family, mothers could devote more time to child care and domestic leisure. The education of middle-class female in domestic crafts, singing, and piano playing prepared them for the function of providing a proper environment for home recreation. (_Western Civilization: A Brief History,_p.502)

**1920s&#39; Jazz-age era of flappers:**  a generation of young  [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) women in the 1920s who wore short skirts,  [bobbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_cut) their hair, listened to  [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz#1920s_and_1930s), and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, [drinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage), treating  [sex in a casual manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_sex), smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the  [Roaring Twenties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties), the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of  [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), as well as the export of  [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)jazz culture to Europe.

**Women&#39;s suffrage movement:** The women&#39;s suffrage movement was the struggle for the right of women to vote and run for office and is part of the overall  [women&#39;s rights](http://www.historynet.com/womens-rights/) movement. In the mid-19th century, women in several countries—most notably, the U.S. and Britain—formed organizations to fight for suffrage. The  [legal right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage) of women to vote in the United States, was established over the course of several decades, first in various states and localities, sometimes on a limited basis, and then nationally in 1920.

**Sexual revolution of the 20**** th **** century:** The sexual revolution, also known as a time of sexual liberation, was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and  [interpersonal relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship) throughout the  [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) from the 1960s to the 1980s. Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of  [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse) outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships (primarily  [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage)). The normalization of [contraception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control) and  [the pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill),  [public nudity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_nudity),  [pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography),  [premarital sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premarital_sex),  [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of  [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion) all followed.

**American family in the 1940s and 1950s:** The emphasis Americans placed on the family and children in the postwar era is seen in the advice by one popular book, &quot;The family is the center of your living. If it isn&#39;t, you&#39;ve gone far astray.&quot;Family demographics between 1940 and 1960 moved notably away from depression and war trends. Marriages were remarkably stable; not until the mid-1960s did the divorce rate begin to rise sharply. The average age at marriage fell during this period, to 21 for men and 20 for women. More important, the drop in the average age at marriage resulted in a baby boom. After a century and half of declining family size, the birth rate shot up and peaked in 1957.

### Critical Reading

**I. Understanding the text**

(1)The key question addressed: How should we understand the current changes in family?

Thesis statement: Family life in the United States is a complex mixture of both continuity and change.

They didn&#39;t offer any solution, but said that the solution to contemporary family problems would not be found in some lost golden age, namely, by restoring the past pattern of family.

(2)The discussion of other transformation, for example, technological advances, organizational innovations, etc. is likely to be full of amazement, enthusiasm and expectation, whereas the talk of family is suffused with nostalgia, confusion, and anxiety. Strangely, they are treated by people with completely different attitudes.

(3)Changes: 1. The two-earner family has replaced the breadwinner/housewife family as the norm.  2. A range of once &quot;deviant&quot; lifestyles–cohabitation, remaining single or childless, having a child while single, gay and lesbian families, have become acceptable.

Reasons for the changes: Transformation in women&#39;s roles; rising divorce rates; lower marriage and birth rate, etc.

Proposed solution: 1. Restore the &quot;traditional&quot; family.  2. Make divorce and single parenthood socially unacceptable once again. 3. Do away with welfare and make divorces more difficult to obtain.

(4)They stand on neither side of the public debate about family. According to the authors, one problem with the popular discourse about family is that the discussion reduces to one extreme position debating the opposite extreme position. It doesn&#39;t reflect the range of views among family scholars and doesn&#39;t fit their research evidence. Another problem is that some family talk exaggerates the extent of change. They believe that family life in the United States if a mixture of both continuity and change.

(5)They cite some examples to support their claim.

Change: Divorce rates have shot up since the 1950s.

Continuity: The trend toward higher divorce rates started in the 19th century, with more marital breakups in each succeeding generation. In fact, the United States still has the highest marriage rates in the industrial world. About 90 percent of Americans marry at some point of their lives. Further, surveys repeatedly show that family is central to the lives of most Americans.

(6)New scholarship tells us that the &quot;lost&quot; golden age of family happiness and stability never actually existed.

Social earthquake: counter culture (hippies), sexual revolution, New Feminism.

Researchers have found that if we look at statistics for the entire 20th century, or back into the 19th century, we can find that today&#39;s young people–with their low marriage, high divorce , and low fertility rates–appear to be behaving quite consistently with long-term historical trends. It was simply the 1940s and 1950s that departed from 20th century trends.

| No. | Myth | Reality | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The family is the same everywhere. | There is no single pattern of family that would hold across time and place. | People tend to regard family arrangements other than those of the nuclear family as sick or immoral. |
| 2 | Family life is harmonious and happy. | Family life is a mixture of strong positive and negative feelings. | The happy-family assumption omits important, if unpleasant, aspects of family life. Family is unduly romanticized. |
| 3 | The kind of family a child grows up leaves a profound, lifelong impact. | Early family experience is not the all-powerful, irreversible influence. | Family influence is exaggerated and people tend to blame the family for children&#39;s problems. |
| 4 | The family was more stable and harmonious in  the earlier times and is in decline currently. | A golden age of the family does not exist. The earlier ears were also marked by conflicts, deviation and changes in regard to the family life. | There is a misconception that the solution to contemporary problems can be found in some lost golden age. |

(8)Infanticide has long been attributed to primitive peoples or assumed to be the desperate act of an unwed mother. It now appears that infanticide provided a major means of population control in all societies lacking reliable contraception, Europe included, and that was practiced by families on legitimate children.

The authors intend to say that the family in the past was not as harmonious, loving, and sweet as we thought. People should not glamorize the past and try to find solution to the current family problems in the lost golden age.

(9)Two earlier periods of family transformation: The first occurred in the early 19th century, when the growth of industry and commerce moved work out of the home. The dislocations in the functions and meaning of family life unleashed an era of personal stress and cultural confusion. The second began around the 1880s, when another period economic, social and cultural change unsettled Victorian family patterns, especially their gender arrangements. Another cultural crisis ensued, as several generations of so-called new women challenged Victorian notions of femininity by pursuing careers, getting involved in political causes, or even engaging in sexual revolution.

The impetus for the first period is industrialization; for the second, 1880s occurred at the core period of the  [Second Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution). Most  [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) countries experienced a large  [economic boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_boom), due to the mass production of  [railroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad) and other more convenient methods of travel. The modern city as well as the  [sky-scraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky-scraper) rose to prominence in this decade as well, contributing to the economic prosperity of the time. The 1880s were also part of the  [Gilded Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age), which lasted from 1874 to 1907.

The family pattern in the 1950s is thought to be traditional, as exemplified by Ozzie and Harriet, with the homemaker mother and breadwinner father.

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1)The authors provide some evidence in the following paragraphs 4 &amp; 5, esp. in para.4: &quot;In the mid-nineties, more than 60 percent of married women with children under six were in the paid labor force.&quot; That is the only statistical evidence. The authors should have given more statistics to support their claim. Besides, they should have made comparisons between the United States and some other countries.

(2)Though the authors do not explain the link when they mention the transformation of women&#39;s roles in paragraph 3, they actually hint on the link when discussing the history of family changes in paragraphs32-35.

The change of women&#39;s roles is closely connected with the transformation of the family. After industrialization was in full swing, women lost their status as their husband&#39;s economic partners and acquired a subordinate status as homemakers. The home was seen as the emotional center of life. But over the last few decades, there have been significant increases in gender equality, female independence through paid employment, and personal freedom for everybody. As a result, a diversity of family types has emerged. 1. Two-career families. More married women than ever have entered the workforce. Their employment has made it difficult, if not impossible, for them to care for their children while going out to work. 2. Divorce. The high divorce rate has many causes, one of which is due to women&#39;s less dependence on men. Women&#39;s increasing participation in the labor force has reduced wives&#39; financial dependence on husbands. Therefore, women find it easier to leave unhappy marriage. 3. Single-parent families. Though the majority of unmarried women have been divorced, separated, widowed, or abandoned by their husband, there has been a significant increase in never-married women having children. The most dramatic increase is among women in managerial and professional jobs and college graduates.

(3)Both examples and counter examples can be found, as studies often draw conflicting conclusions. Many studies indicate divorce lowers the well-being of children in the short-term, affecting school achievement, peer relationships, and behavior. However, more important may be the long-term or lasting effects on their achievement and quality of life as these children become adults. On the other hand, some studies find that children who are well-adjusted to begin with have an easier time with divorce. For instance, Ahrons (2004) found no general long-term negative consequences of parental divorce in her extensive longitudinal study that traced people into their middle years.

(4)The past, like everything else that is no more, can be easily idealized. It is the feelings of nostalgia that skew these people&#39;s view of the past. But believing in a reality that never was can hamper the ability to deal with the reality that currently is. On the other hand, some of these people may be social or religious conservatives who are committed to the traditional family values and dedicated to the protection of traditional marriage and family as the cornerstone of society.

(5)Family problem is a multi-faceted and complicated problem that cannot be solved with a single solution. One thing for sure is that we will not resolve our problems by looking to the past. We must try to reconcile the individual freedoms most of us have come to value in our personal lives with the need to form stable and lasting relations with other people.

(6)A family can be defined as a group of persons directly linked by kin connections, the adult members of whom assume responsibility for caring for children. Kinship ties are connections between individuals, established either through marriage or through the lines of descent that connect blood relatives. Marriage can be defined as a socially acknowledge and approved sexual union between two adult individuals.

If individuals should have the freedom to define their own living arrangements as a family, what if some individuals want to practice polygamy? If they should not, how do you explain that many societies have consented to gay marriage?

Society does have an interest in stipulating the legitimate form of family for the wellbeing of the whole society.

(7)The future will be much the same as it is today: maintaining diversity without destroying the basic family values. The majority of young people still value marriage, parenthood, and family life. They plan to marry, have children, and be successful in marriage. Even if they stay single, it will usually be because they care too much about marriage, not too little. They want to get it right by finding &quot;the perfect soul-mate of their dreams&quot; (Thio, Sociology)

(8)Similarities: 1)The average family size was between 4-6 people before industrialization. 2)Industrialization reduced the family size. 3) In traditional families, women were subordinate to the husband as homemakers.

Differences: The change of family size in the United States took place much earlier than that in China, since industrialization in America occurred much earlier.

Women&#39;s role in the family in China significantly changed during the reforms in the late  [Qing Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty), the  [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War), and rise of the  [People&#39;s Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China), which publicly committed itself to gender equality. As a result, most Chinese families are dual-earner families. It was not until 1979 that such alternative family types as divorce, single-parent families, cohabitation, singlehood, gay and lesbian families began to emerge significantly.

1. (1)Instead, the discussion of family is often full of sweet memories about the past, a feeling of being at a loss for the present, and a real worry for the future. We often wonder what has happened to American nuclear family as depicted in the situation comedy _The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet_ in the 1950s.

1. (2)In the past, people could not imagine that gay and lesbian families could be accepted or even tolerated. But although they have experienced continuous social disapproval and threat of violence, they now have largely been accepted.

1. (3)It&#39;s not surprising that public debate about the family often looks like a food fight in which everybody is involved in the debate, and as the debate moves from one hot topic to another, everybody takes sides and engages in verbal attacks against the other.

1. (4)Being gentle with infants, that is, regarding babies as precious to the family is not simply an inborn or innate feeling. It seems to appear only when economy improves and babies have a good chance to stay alive. And it does not appear until adults obtain enough sense of security so that they would not think that children are competing with them for food.

1. (5)In short, since work had moved out of home, the older pattern of family life was radically changed, which resulted in a big difference between the way people actually lived and the socially assigned roles for men and women; younger and older generations. (Industrialization and urbanization created a distinct change in roles; the wife and child became dependent on the husband who &quot;brought home the bread.&quot; The family members became consumers rather than independent and self-supporting coworkers on a farm.)

关于当前的家庭状况，部分困惑源于家庭是一个出奇难的研究领域，极少有不言而喻的事实，即便是数据事实也一样。比如，研究人员发现，当家庭生活的数据描述的是整个二十个世纪，或更早的十九世纪，一个令人惊讶的发现出现了：今天的年轻人，以他们的低结婚率，高离婚率，低生育率，显然表现得与长期的历史趋势相一致。家庭生活最近的变化，只有将它与20世纪40年代和50年代相比的时候，才显得不正常。而正是战后的一代人，他们年纪轻轻就结婚、搬到郊区、有三、四个或更多的孩子，是他们背离了20世纪的家庭生活常态。正如一份研究所表明的那样：&quot;若20世纪40和50年代没有发生，今天的年轻人看起来会很正常&quot;。

**Hidden curriculum** is a concept that describes the often unarticulated and unacknowledged things that students are taught in school and is an important issue in the sociological study of how schools generate social inequality. For example, female students, students in lower-class families, or those belonging to subordinate racial categories, are often treated in ways that create or reinforce inferior self-images. They are also often granted little trust, independence, or autonomy and are thus willing to submit to authority for the rest of their lives. On the other hand, students who belong to dominant social groups tend to be treated in ways that enhance their self-esteem, independence, and autonomy and are therefore more likely to be successful.

**Harlem**  is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the  [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)  [borough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_(New_York_City)) of  [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan). Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major  [African-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American) residential, cultural and business center.For many decades, Harlem has been a center of controversy over the lower quality of public  [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States) in African American and [lower-income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States) communities in the United States.

**Hollywood** is a neighborhood in the  [central region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Los_Angeles) of  [Los Angeles, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California). The neighborhood is notable for its place as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios. Its name has come to be a  [metonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy) for the  [motion picture industry of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States). Hollywood is also a highly ethnically diverse, densely populated, economically diverse neighborhood and retail business district.

**The problems:**

1. It confuses the students. It presents an incoherent ensemble of information that the child needs to memorize to stay in school. Apart from the tests and trials, this programming is similar to the television; it fills almost all the &quot;free&quot; time of children. One sees and hears something, only to forget it again.
2. It teaches them to accept their  [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_class) affiliation.
3. It makes them indifferent.
4. It makes them emotionally dependent.
5. It makes them intellectually dependent.
6. It teaches them a kind of self-confidence that requires constant confirmation by experts (provisional self-esteem).
7. It makes it clear to them that they cannot hide, because they are always supervised.

**His proposed solution:**

He promotes  [homeschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling), and specifically  [unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) and  [open source learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Learning).

### Critical Reading

**I. Understanding the text**

**1.**

(1) Gatto addresses the unwritten aspects of schooling, that is,the attitudes, values, and unwritten rules ofbehavior that schools teach other than the formal curriculum. Clearly the hidden curriculum focuses on the structure of schooling rather than its content. The lessons are not explicitly taught, but are implicit in school procedures and organization.

(2) The first lesson he teaches is confusion. Consequences: 1. Students leave school with only a vague memory of some superficial jargons derived from economics, sociology, natural science, rather than genuine knowledge and genuine enthusiasm. 2. Students do not have any idea of the system of knowledge, because things taught are unrelated to each other, lacking in logical coherence and full of internal contradictions.

(3) By class position, Gatto means class hierarchy. Schools teach students to accept the status quo (para.8: at least to endure it like good sports), to know their place within the class hierarchy (Para. 8: …the kids can&#39;t even imagine themselves somewhere else…; You come to know your place.) and to defer to their betters (…I&#39;ve shown them how to envy and fear the better classes and how to have contempt for the dumb classes.)

(4) The rule of the class bell at the start and end of lessons teaches indifference, as it suggests that no lesson is ever so important that it can carry on after the bell sounds, so why care too deeply about anything?

(5) Gatto says that by using stars and red checks, smiles and frowns, prizes, honors, and disgraces, he teaches students to surrender their will to authority figures. He will permit an act he deems legitimate and exercise discipline for behavior that threatens his control.

When free will appears, he will decide whether to grant it or deny it based on whether the students have displayed good behavior or not, and he may withdraw the privileges as he likes. In this way he conditions the students to depend on his favors.

(6)Teachers make sure that students are intellectually obedient by punishing deviants who resist being told what to learn and to think. They make sure that students wait for experts to make decisions for them. They will not let students&#39; curiosity take important place in deciding what to learn and when to learn, only conformity. Teachers have tested procedures to break the will of those who resist and guarantee intellectual obedience.
Clearly, students trained in this way will out to be lacking in independent thinking, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, mindlessly obeying the rules and the authority figures.

(7)Because if kids are fully self-confident, it will be difficult to make them conform, as they will always assert their individuality. Besides, the world wouldn&#39;t survive a flood of confident people very long, either. Self-confidence jeopardizes social conformity and social order.
Schools teach provisional self-esteemby convincing the kids that their self-respect depends on expert opinion. They should be constantly evaluated and judged by certified officials.

(8)Students are evaluated by the casual judgment of certified officials in the form of report cards, grades, and records, in which self-evaluation never plays a role. Report cards, grades and tests drive homethe idea that children should not trust themselves or their parents but should instead rely on the evaluation of experts. They also help to create a perpetual feeling of dissatisfaction that a parent may have with the child, which clearly works to the advantage of the school.

(9)The last lesson taught is that being under constant surveillanceis normal. By way of homework, and by encouraging parents to file reports about their own children,the effect of surveillance is effectively transferred to the home environment. The effect of this &quot;all-time&quot; surveillance is that children lose their freedom and free time to learn something unauthorized from a father or mother, by exploration or by apprenticing to some wise person in the neighborhood.

(10)&quot;A different way&quot; could mean unschooling or homeschooling.

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1)Gatto definitely means what he says by the &quot;seven lessons&quot;. The general tone is strongly critical. Whether he goes to an extreme depends on personal view (with textual evidence). In fact, conflict theorists constantlystress that the hidden curriculum helps to perpetuate social inequalities. For example, in their highly influential study of education in the U.S., Bowles and Gintis (1976) argued that a hidden curriculum exists within education systems, through which pupils learn discipline, hierarchy and passive acceptance of the status quo. Though Gatto did not take Marxist perspective, he reached a similar conclusion. In fact, one of the most controversial theorists to explore the consequences of the hidden curriculum is Austrian anarchist, Ivan Illich (1926-2002). He argued that schools, like prisons, have become custodial organizations because attendance is compulsory and young people are therefore &#39;kept off the streets&#39;between early childhood and their entry into work. Since schools do not promote equality or the development of individual creative abilities, why not do away with them altogether in their current form? Illich advocated what he called the deschooling of society.

(2)The answer depends on students&#39; individual understanding. The following two paragraphs (one from our text and the other from the original text) can be used to provide a hint to the students. Ask them to comment (whether they agree or not).
What big ideas are important to little kids? Well, the biggest idea I think they needis that what they are learning isn&#39;t idiosyncratic—that there is some system to it alland it&#39;s not just raining down on them as they helplessly absorb. That&#39;s the task, tounderstand, to make coherent.
Meaning, not disconnected facts, is what sanehuman beings seek, and education is a set of codes forprocessing raw data into meaning. Behind the patchwork quilt of school sequences and the school obsessionwith facts and theories, the age-old human search formeaning lies well concealed. This is harder to see in elementary school where the hierarchy of school experienceseems to make better sense because thegood-naturedsimple relationship between &quot;let&#39;s do this&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s dothat&quot; is just assumed to mean something and the clientele has not yet consciously discerned how littlesubstance is behind the play and pretense.

(3)Despite controversy over standardized tests, most schools in the United States use them for **tracking**. Tracking supposedly helps teachers meet each students&#39; individual needs and abilities. However, one educational critic, Jonathan Kozol (1992), considers tracking an example of &quot;savage inequalities&quot; in American school system. Most students from privileged backgrounds do well on standardized tests and get into higher tracks, where they receive the best the school can offer. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds typically do less well on these tests and end up in lower tracks, where teachers stress memorization and put little focus on creativity.The result is that students from lower social classes and minority groups are clustered in the lower tracks and complete fewer years and lower levels of school.
Tracking can help match instruction with students&#39; abilities, but rigid tracking can have a powerful impact on students&#39; learning and self-concept. Young people who spend years in higher tracks tend to see themselves as bright and able; students in lower tracks end up with less ambition and low self-esteem.
The negative effects of tracking can be reduced if the system of placement is flexible, allowing students to be placed in different tracks by subject matter and ensuring reevaluation of students frequently so that they are not locked into placements.

(4)

**Reinforcing the existing social inequality**

a)Through hidden curriculum, schools teach obedience to authority and conformity to mainstream norms, reinforcing acceptance of the status quo.
b)Some students receive elite educations and others do not in part because of class, race, and gender differences. Because elite schools are very expensive and highly selective, elite members of society have the most access to them.
c)Most schools in the U.S. practice tracking, sorting students into different groups according to past academic achievement. Studies found that higher-income students tend to be in higher-track classes and lower-class and minority students in lower –track classes. It was further discovered that higher-track students were taught &quot;a more independent type of thinking – self-direction, creativity, critical thinking, pursuing individual assignments, and active involvement in the process of learning.&quot;By contrast, lower-track students were taught &quot;a more conforming type of classroom behavior– working quietly, punctuality, cooperation, improving study habits, conforming to rules and expectations, and getting along with others.&quot;Higher-income students were, in effect, taught to be high-paid professionals, while lower-class and minority students were taught to become low-paid manual workers.

**A path to upward social mobility**

American sociologist, Talcott Parsons, argued that a central function of education was to instill in pupils the value of individual achievement. This value was crucial to the functioning of industrialized societies, but it could not be learned in the family. A child&#39;s status in the family is ascribed – that is, fixed from birth. By contrast, a child&#39;s status in school is largely achieved, and in schools children are assessed according to universal standards, such as exams. According to Parsons, schools, like the wider society, largely operate on meritocratic basis: children achieve their status according to merit (or worth) rather than according to their sex, race or class. Though Parson&#39;s view has been subject to much criticism, it is believed by some functionalist theorists that schooling increases meritocracy by rewarding talent and hard work regardless of social background and provides a path to upward social mobility.

(5)Functional and conflict theorists viewhidden curriculum in a different light. For functionalists,it is through the hidden curriculum that students learn the expectations, behaviors, and values necessary to succeed in school and society. For conflict theorists, the hidden curriculum serves to differentiate social classes: more is expected of members of elite classes, and they are given greater responsibility and opportunities for problem solving that result in higher achievement, whereas non-elite schools stress order and discipline over achievement obey.
Although some behavioral norms such as conformity and obedience are essential for occupational success, in a classroom that is overly focused on obedience, students will be conditioned to remain quiet rather than creative. In our age of computers and other electronic technology, critical thinking, analytical skills and creativeness may be more important than conformity and obedience.So in regard to hidden curriculum, we should consider both its positive and negative sides.

(6) The question is open to answer.

(7)

**Advantages:**

a)Their curriculum—although it includes the subjects that are requiredby the state—is designed around the students&#39; interests andneeds.
b)Homeschoolers receive intense, one-on-one teaching.
c)Contraryto stereotypes, homeschooled children are notisolated. As part of theireducational experience,their parents take them tolibraries, museums, factories, and nursing homes. Moreover, they develop social skills by associating with people of different ages and backgrounds rather than mostly with their peers.

**Disadvantage:**

a)Without official transcripts, home-schooledchildren may have some difficulties being admitted by colleges.
b)Home schooling reduces the amount of funding going to local public schools, which ends up hurting the majority of students.

(8) one or the other; or both
&quot;The one continuing purpose of education, since ancient times, has been to bring people to as full a realization as possible of what it is to be a human being. Other statements of educational purpose have also been widely accepted: to develop the intellect, to serve social needs, to contribute to the economy, to create an effective work force, to prepare students for a job or career, to promote a particular social or political system…The broader humanistic purpose includes all of them, and goes beyond them, for it seeks to encompass all the dimensions of human experience.&quot; —Arthur W. Foshay, &quot;The Curriculum Matrix: Transcendence and Mathematics,&quot; Journal of Curriculum and Supervision, 1991
Maslow describes the self-actualized person as havingfull use and exploitation of talent, capacities, potentialities, etc. Every person is unique. Every person has individual needs, desires, dreams, hopes, fears, and aspirations. Every person is limited in his capacities, but it is not the job of the school to try and diagnose these capacities by means of some curve of normality and thereby deprive any person of the chance to develop those capacities to less than the maximum. The needs of the individual being paramount, it is conclusive that we must approach education with a school program that is geared to the needs, interests, and abilities of each of the students. This is exactly what is necessary: a separate curriculum for each student within the school, a personalized program of study for each student.

## Unit 11 Urbanization and the Environment

**Text A**

### Preparatory Work

(1)

**Shanty-town:** A shanty town or squatter area is a settlement of improvised housing, called shanties or shacks, made of plywood, corrugated metal, sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Such settlements are usually found on the periphery of cities, in public parks, or near railroad tracks, rivers, lagoons or city trash dump sites. Sometimes called a squatter, informal or spontaneous settlement, a typical shanty town often lacks proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity, hygienic streets, or other basic human necessities.

**Metropolitan area:** A metropolitan area, sometimes referred to as a metro area or just metro, is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.

**Smog:** Smog is a type of air pollutant. The word &quot;smog&quot; was coined in the early 20th century as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog.Man-made smog is derived from coal emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions.

**Infrastructure:** Infrastructure refers to structures, systems, and facilities serving a country, city, or area, including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function. It typically characterizes technical structures such as roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications, and so forth, and can be defined as &quot;the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions.&quot;

**Commuting:** Commuting is periodically recurring travel between one&#39;s place of residence and place of work, or study, and in doing so exceed the boundary of their residential community. It sometimes refers to any regular or often repeated traveling between locations, even when not work-related.

**Downtown:** Downtown is a term primarily used in North America by English speakers to refer to a city&#39;s core (or center) or central business district (CBD), often in a geographical, commercial, or communal sense. The term is not generally used in British English, whose speakers instead use the term city center.The term is thought to have been coined in New York City, where it was in use by the 1830s to refer to the original town at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan.During the late 19th century, the term was gradually adopted by cities across the United States and Canada to refer to the historical core of the city (which was most often the same as the commercial heart of the city).

**Greenway:** A greenway is &quot;a strip of undeveloped land near an urban area, set aside for recreational use or environmental protection&quot;. However, the term can in fact include &quot;a scenic road&quot; and though many are in urban areas. A greenway is a trail (and sometimes a wildlife corridor), found in both urban and rural settings, that is frequently created, out of a disused railway, canal towpath, utility, or similar right of way, or derelict industrial land.

**Urban sprawl:** Urban sprawl or suburban sprawl describes the expansion of human populations away from central urban areas into low-density, monofunctional and usually car-dependent communities, in a process called suburbanization. In addition to describing a particular form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development.The term urban sprawl is highly politicized, and almost always has negative connotations. It is criticized for causing environmental degradation, and intensifying segregation and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas and attacked on aesthetic grounds.

**Traffic congestion:** Traffic congestion is a condition on transport networks that occurs as use increases, and is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. The most common example is the physical use of roads by vehicles. When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream, this results in some congestion.Traffic congestion can lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in road rage.

(2)

**Town:** A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a &quot;town&quot; varies considerably in different parts of the world.

**City:** A city is a large and permanent human settlement.] Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.Cities generally have complex systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage, housing, and transportation.

**Metropolis:** A metropolisis a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the &quot;mother city&quot; of a colony (in the ancient sense). A big city belonging to a larger urban agglomeration, but which is not the core of that agglomeration, is not generally considered a metropolis but a part of it.

**Megacity:** A megacity is usually defined as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of ten million people. A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or two or more metropolitan areas that converge. As of 2015, there are 35 megacities in existence. The largest of these are the metropolitan areas of Tokyo and Shanghai, each of these having a population of over 30 million inhabitants, with 38.8 million and 35.5 million respectively. Tokyo is the world&#39;s largest metropolitan area, while Shanghai has the world&#39;s largest city proper population.

**Global city:** A global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, is a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. The use of &quot;global city&quot;, as opposed to &quot;megacity&quot;, was popularized by sociologist SaskiaSassen in her 1991 work, _The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo_;although the term &quot;world city&quot;, which refers to cities that control a disproportionate amount of global business, dates to at least the May 1886 description of Liverpool, by_The Illustrated London News_. More recently, the term has been described as being synonymous with a city&#39;s influence and &#39;financial capital&#39;, with other factors becoming less relevant.

**2.**

1. (1)City-planning has profound impacts on human and environmental well-being. Uncontrolled urban growth can destroy the natural resources and create social disparity. Thus the world needs an urban-planning ethic that is sensitive to these environmental and human dimensions.
2. (2)Congestion and pollution from motor vehicles, a lack of affordable housing, and the cancerous growth of blighted districts.
3. (3)Western Europe has a long tradition of actively controlling land use so that the small amount of available space serves the public&#39;s interest more than that of private developers. North America and Australia have the weakest planning traditions. Governments on these continents have done relatively little to guide development beyond separating industrial areas from those zoned for commerce and housing. Developing countries have the loosest controls over how cities develop. The enormous rapidly growing cites there are racked with pollution and rimmed by shanty-towns.
4. (4)Compartmentalizing and zoning laws, which separate work place from living quarters, have caused both waste of land in the environment and waste of time for the commuters. To solve these problems, city planning should focus on transportation planning, and a city&#39;s transport system functions better if things are closer to home.
5. (5)In well-established cities, dispersed areas can be made more compact by filling in underused space to improve their land-use patterns.
6. (6)These cities can also allow homeowners to rent out small apartments within their houses to increase housing density.
7. (7)Portland is a rapidly growing city of roughly 500,000 people. Stead of giving in to ever growing automobile dependence and sprawl, Portland has encircled itself with an Urban Growth Boundary beyond which new development is not allowed. Reinforced by zoning reforms, the Urban Growth Boundary allows Portland to grow quickly but compactly. The city has increased its housing density by encouraging a blend of mulit- and single-family homes in pleasant, compact pattern. Its vibrant downtown boasts green spaces. City officials welcome new office construction but restrict the amount of accompanying parking. As a result, in two decades, the volume of cars entering Portland&#39;s downtown has remained the same even though the number of jobs there has increased by 50%.
8. (8)Nearly every urban area has two faces—one well-housed and connected to a variety of services and amenities, and the other, ill-housed and excluded from many such opportunities. Governments can enhance the supply of affordable housing and promote a mixture of housing types to resolve the problem.
9. (9)Many large cities are finding that the most transport-efficient land-use pattern combines a dense, well-mixed downtown with several, outlying, compact centers of activity—all linked by an extensive public transport system, for example Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. (para. 19) Instead of giving in to eve greater automobile dependence and sprawl, Portland, Ohio, USA has encircled itself with an Urban Growth Boundary beyond which new development is not allowed. (para.20) The city has increased its housing density by encouraging a blend of multi- and single-family homes in pleasant, compact pattern. It also welcomes new office construction but restrict the amount of accompanying parking. (para. 21)
10. (10)First, the general public and decision makers need better access to information about the characteristics of a community&#39;s population and the possible consequences of various planning decisions. Second, cities and surrounding areas need a greater degree of regional cooperation t prevent land use in on jurisdiction from producing problems in others. Third, urban areas in virtually all countries need stronger support from their national governments, giving them budgetary power to plan their own long-term development strategies.

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1) **Tentative answer:** I basically agree with the author about this phenomenon based on two reasons – one is that many examples in developing countries (Mexico, Brazil, India, South Arica, Egypt) support this statement; the other is the root cause that the third world countries have experienced fast economic growth and urbanization (the big cities such as Mexico City and Bombay) but have not yet found time to address the unbalance of the polarization between the haves and have-nots. One of the few exceptionsis China which has done relatively better job in this regard (large numbers of big cities emerging and absorbing labors from the rural areas and relatively balanced and equal developmentin housing and transport provision for all citizens)

(2) **Advantages:** it&#39;s more efficient and easier to organize and build working areas and resident areas separately (residents can be protected from possible risks and dangers from traffic and factories).

Disadvantages: since resident areas are separated from the work place or factories, it takes a lot of time for the workers to commute between the two areas, and also it inevitably causes traffic congestion.

(3) **Summary:** (1) Instead of giving in to ever greater automobile dependence and sprawl, Portland has encircled itself with an Urban Growth Boundary, an invisible line similar to England&#39;s green belts, beyond which new development is not allowed.(2) The city has increased its housing density by encouraging a blend of multi- and single-family homes in pleasant, compact pattern, and therefore successfully controlled housing prices. (3) The city has also built or expanded green spaces in the downtown(city center).

Chinese cities can definitely learn from these experiences and realize balanced development, however, each city has its own features (land forms, population size, industries, climate etc.) and it should not simply copy the Portland model but follow its principle of balanced and sustainable development.

(4)&quot;Making urban areas more humane includes planning the use of street space. In cities all over the world, automobile traffic needs to be held in check. Many European cities have redesigned roads in order to &#39;calm&#39; traffic. Typically this entails reduced speed limits and strategically placed trees, bushes, flowerbeds, or play areas along or in the roadway—gentle inducements that make drivers proceed slowly and yield the right-of-way to pedestrians, cyclists, and children at play.&quot; (para. 26)

Yes, definitely, humane cities need to put the well-being of the pedestrians (who should equally follow the traffic rules) ahead of the drivers, and China&#39;s bit cities need to improve in this respect (although the great number of people on the street makes it more difficult to realize). China&#39;s big cities also have its own advantages in the provision of public transport (buses, subways, and city-link trains) and workers should be encouraged to use it instead of driving cars to work.

(5) **Tentative answer:** Singapore is a well-planned city with mature and developed business areas, clean and beautiful resident areas, advanced public transport system, reserved green land, and controlled private cars (As Singapore is a small island with a high population density, the number of private cars on the road is restricted so as to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers must pay for duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle&#39;s market value, and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which allows the car to run on the road for a decade).These provide good principles and insights for China&#39;s cities to learn from. You can compare these aspects with your own home city to find room for improvement.

(6)Food for thoughts:Big cities can absorb and transform large number of the surplus labor in the rural areas, provide a lot of job opportunity, have high-quality resources in culture, education, health care, and recreational activities, but the drawbacks are higher cost of living (including house price), serious traffic congestion, a lot of noise and air pollution. Small and medium-sized cities are basically opposite to the big ones in the above mentioned respects.

Tentative solution: small, medium and big cities are all needed in China because of their different functions, but they should be balanced in development –the number of mega cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chongqing should be limited due to the huge pressure on environment (but they serve as political, business, or transport centers of the country or regions); medium cities should be encouraged for its ideal balance of population size and the environment; but small cities should not be neglected (they are the basis for the other two types).

(7) **Tentative answer:** Major causes of traffic congestion and air pollution: too many private cars (causing both traffic congestion and air pollution), inadequate public transport capacity, manufacturing factories, traditional fuel burning for central heating in the winter, dust caused by construction sites.

Solutions: control the number and use of private cars (through various means), develop public transport system, esp. subway, close down polluting factories, replace coal burning with natural gas in the central heating season, and reduce dust of construction sites.

(8) **Food for thought:** you can discuss the problems from logical organization of the functional areas (such as teaching/learning area vs resident area vs dining area), clean environment and adequate infrastructure (green land, pond, sports center etc.), degree of convenience (distance between different areas), and then propose for improvement if there&#39;re flaws.

(9) **Food for thought:** with the rapid development such as online shopping and the service industry (some of its business such as translation, editing and designing) make it possible for the employees to work from home), where the employee live will be irrelevantto where the company he/she works for is located. This will give much more freedom for the employee to decide where he/she should live, and people will not crowd into big cities and suffer bad environment. Perhaps, small and medium cities as well as suburban areas of big cities with good environment will flourish.

(10)This question is open. The reader can use what they have learned from this unit (general principles of balanced and sustainable development as well as specific measures to realize it) to evaluate the government&#39;s plan.

一个城市对土地的利用方式比任何交通专家或工程师的计划和决策更能决定其交通系统的特点。城市发展的模式决定了人们是否能步行或骑车去上班或者需要乘几十公里的车去上班，也决定了一条新的公交线路或轻轨线路是否能吸引足够多的乘客。总之，如果以离家就近原则来设计，交通系统就能发挥更好的作用。由于未能意识到交通系统在城市土地利用方面的战略作用，世界上的许多城市对汽车放任自流而任其主导城市的发展。很少有人能够预见，这种发展方向所造成的交通拥堵、致命事故、城市噪音、化学烟雾等城市恶疾，于此同时这总发展方式也造成了无车人的边缘化。

## Unit 12 Deviance and Crime

**Text A**

### Preparatory Work

(1)

**Vandalism** is action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property. It includes behavior such as breaking windows, slashing tires, spray painting a wall with graffiti, and destroying a computer system through the use of a computer virus. Vandalism is a malicious act and may reflect personal ill will, although the perpetrators need not know their victim to commit vandalism. The recklessness of the act imputes both intent and malice.

**A bad check** is a check that you cannot cash because the person who wrote the check: 1) doesn&#39;t have sufficient funds to cover it; or 2) told the bank to stop payment on it without having a valid reason for doing so. **Writing or passing a bad check** is a crime if the check writer knew that there were insufficient funds to cover the check and intended to defraud someone.

**Juvenile delinquent** is a person who is under age (usu. blow 18), who is found to have committed a crime in states which have declared by law that a minor lacks responsibility and thus may not be sentenced as an adult. However, the legislatures of several states have reduced the age of criminal responsibility for serious crimes or for repeat offenders to as low as 14.

**Larceny** generally refers to nonviolent theft. It is a common-law term developed by the royal courts of England in the 17th century. In the United States, most jurisdictions have eliminated the crime of larceny from statutory codes, in favor of a general

**Victimless crime** is acrime where there is no apparent victim and no apparent pain or injury. This class of crime usually involves only consenting adults in activities such as prostitution, sodomy, and gaming where the acts are not public, no one is harmed, and no one complains of the activities. Some groups advocate legalizing victimless crimes by removing these acts from the law books. Other critics complain that there is no such thing as a victim crime; whenever one of these crimes is committed but goes unpunished, individual mores, societal values and the Rule of Law are undermined, or compromised, rendering society itself the victim. theft statute.

(2)

**Deviant acts** : binge drinking (drinking  [alcoholic beverages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage) with an intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time. It is a style of drinking that overlaps somewhat with  [social drinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_drinking)since it is often done in groups), using pornography, speeding, stealing from a campus bookstore, patronizing a prostitute, appearing nude in public, etc.

**Crimina**** l acts**: homicide, robbery, stealing, rape, drug abuse, etc.

(3)

In  [criminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology),  **differentialassociation**  is a theory developed by [Edwin Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Sutherland) proposing that through interaction with others, individuals learn the values, attitudes, techniques, and motives for criminal  [behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior).The differential association theory is the most talked about of the learning theories of  [deviance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)). This theory focuses on how individuals learn to become  [criminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminals), but does not concern itself with why they become criminals.(para.7)

**Strain theory** is a sociology and criminology theory developed in 1957 by  [Robert K. Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton). The theory states that society puts pressure on individuals to achieve  socially accepted goals (such as the American dream) though they lack the means, this leads to strain which may lead the individuals to commit crimes, examples being selling drugs or becoming involved in prostitution to gain financial security. (paras. 8-10)

**Labeling theory**  is the theory of how the  [self-identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-identity) and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them. It is associated with the concepts of  [self-fulfilling prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) and  [stereotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype). Labeling theory holds that  [deviance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)) is not inherent to an act, but instead focuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those seen as deviant from standard  [cultural norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_norm). (paras.18-24)

(4)

Throughout his career, **Durkheim was concerned** primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline. Second, to analyze how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed; to that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and  [social integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration). Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge.

**Major works:**

_The Division OfLabour In Society (1893), The Rules Of Sociological Method (1895) Suicide (1897), and The Elementary Forms Of Religious Life (1912)._

**Durkheim&#39;s views on crime** were a departure from conventional notions. He believed that crime is &quot;bound up with the fundamental conditions of all  [social life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation)&quot; and serves a social function. [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim#cite_note-AppelrouthEdles2007-31) He stated that crime implies, &quot;not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.&quot; Examining the  [trial of Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Socrates), he argues that &quot;his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country&quot; as &quot;it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed&quot;. As such, his crime &quot;was a useful prelude to reforms&quot;. In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that &quot;the authority which the moral  [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience) enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible&quot;.

### Critical Reading

**I. Understanding the text**

**1.**

(1)

He does not agree with any of the three explanations, because none of the perspectives can apply to all the crimes. The brutal punishment entailed by conservative explanation has not proven effective. The liberal theories, with their broken-family-and-blighted-neighborhood hypothesis about crime, cannot explain why it is not just the poorer social classes that commit crimes. Finally, the radical perspective, which attributes criminality to law-enforcement or even the law itself, cannot explain &quot;real&quot; crimes such as robbery, murder, rape, etc. In his view, there is one perspectivethat encompasses all – one that declares that crime is normal, and even necessary, feature of all societies.

(2)

| - | Conservative explanations | Liberal explanations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Why some people entera life of crime | They commit crimes due to their bad personal characteristics. | 1. They have gotten in with the wrong crowd.  2. They come from broken homes and run-down neighborhoods, where stresses and strains make people hostile and insecure, and lead them to a life of crime.  3. They lack opportunities to change their social condition. |
| Measures to deal withcriminals | Severe punishments should be used as a deterrent for crime. | Various social causes for crime are to be counteracted by appropriate social reforms, such as providing youth services, initiating urban renewal projects, improving the life chances of the disadvantaged, etc. |
| Assumptions underlyingthe arguments | It is good to be tough and even brutal or malicious to offenders. | Crime is not really the fault of the criminal. It is only the adverse social conditions that force them into a criminal career. |
| Whether the measuresare effective or not | It has never really worked. | It simply has not worked very well. |
| Reasons for effectivenessor ineffectiveness | Punishing criminals is a political position, or moral philosophy, not advocated based on the result. | The underlying theories just may not be accurate, e.g.: the evidence does not exactly bear out the strain theory. |

(3)Whereas liberal position makes an effort to understand criminals, Radical perspective shifts its focus away from the criminal side onto the law-enforcement side, proposing that crimes are created by the law-enforcement agents.

Psychological way of describing the labeling process: All sorts of youths violate the law. They engage in petty thefts and acts of vandalism. They are then apprehended by the authorities for one thing another. But some of them get off with a warning. If a young offender is actually arrested, charged with a crime, convicted, it will have a crucial effect upon the rest of his or her life. They are now labeled a criminal, and may be stuck with that label for life and may be rejected and isolated as a result. Finding a job and making friends may be extremely difficult. More important, the person may come to accept the label and commit more criminal acts.

Collins offers an explanation of the labeling process by focusing on the organization of the law-enforcement rather than on the deviant&#39;s mind. In order to promote the rate of solving crimes, the police will pay a surprise search on formerly convicted criminals since they are the easiest to arrest. Often it is not hard to find stolen property, illegal drugs, or other violations, since drugs are a part of the criminal culture. So the police engage in the labeling process that keeps people going in criminal careers.

(4)A stronger version of the radical approach argues that it is not simply the police who create the criminals but the law itself. The example cited: Possession of drugs such as narcotics was not a crime until laws were passed making private possession of them a felony.

Illegalizing drugs, by raising the prices, suddenly creates a bunch of drug-related crimes. Smuggling and bribery expanded, so did burglary and robbery. Most drug addicts, unable to pay for the expense of a costly habit, turned to theft as a main way keeping the supply.

(5)Crimes are manufactured by &quot;moralentrepreneurs&quot;: the Prohibition (of liquor) in the U.S. from 1920-1933, the result of an effort made by Anglo-American Protestants to try to remove what they saw as the degenerate alcoholic culture of the immigrants in the big cities. Other examples are prostitution, gambling, pornography.

Crimes created out of economic andorganizational interests: all kinds of economic crimes, tax evasion, intellectual property violation; etc.

(6) For example, car theft, robbery can be viewed as being created by the propertied class to protect their properties from the poor class people. Receiving the least ofsociety&#39;s material rewards, the working class and those below them pose a special threat to the interests of the wealthy elite. To prevent this, the law comes down hard on thepoor and the underclass.

(7) According to Collins, the stratified pattern of crime is not primarily the poor robbing (and murdering and raping) the rich. Criminals are not Robin Hoods. People rob, burglarize, murder and rape in their own neighborhoods, because these are the easiest opportunities, especially for teenagers.

(8) The largest single category of murders happens within the family, especially one spouse murdering the other. This is becauseintimate relations will inevitably involve antagonism as well as love. While the people we love can give us great pleasure in life, they can also be a major source of unhappiness.

(9)1. Victimless crime, created by social movements or labeled as criminal as a result of the law-enforcement process. 2. Property crimes, which would by no means disappear if laws stopped being enforced. 3. Crimes of passion, which seem to be of personal nature and do not seem to be related to the factors discussed.

**II. Evaluation and exploration**

(1)He associates the idea of sin and punishment or punishment for deterrence with the conservative position; differential association theory and stain theory with the liberal position; and labeling theory and social reality theory (the theory that maintains that criminal law is used by the state and the ruling class to secure the survival of the capitalist system) with the radical position.

Unique association, usu. Different theories of deviant behavior are connected with different sociological perspectives: functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.

Some theories of criminality or deviance do not fall into the three perspectives, such as phenomenological theory (emphasizing that to understand deviance, we should rely heavily on people&#39;s subjectiveinterpretations of their own deviant experiences) and postmodernist theory (also advocating subjectivity).

(2)According to Durkheim, deviance can serve a number of functions for society. First, it helps enhance conformity in society as a whole. Norms are basically abstract an ambiguous. Form deviants we can learn the difference between conformity and deviance, seeing the boundary between right and wrong more clearly. Second, deviance strengthens solidarity among law-abiding members of society. Collective outrage against deviants as a common enemy can unite people. Third, deviance provides a safety valve for discontented people. Through relatively minor forms of deviance, they can strike out against the social order without doing serious harm to themselves or others. Fourth, deviance can induce social change, as deviancemay force agroup to rethink and redefine its moral boundaries.

There is a limit, however, to the validity of Durkheim&#39;s functionalist theory. If deviance is widespread, it can threaten social order in at least two ways. First, ite can wreck interpersonal relations. Second, deviance can undermine trust. Nevertheless, Durkheim&#39;s theory is useful for demolishing the commonsense belief that deviance is always harmful. Deviance can bring benefits if it occurs within limits.

(3)According labeling theorists, the meaning that people attach to an act is much more important than the act itself. People do not respond directly to the act, but to their interpretations of the act. The frequent surprisesearch by the police maygenerate negative response from the ex-convict. It may strengthen their deviant conduct as a reaction to the penalties. It leads them to commit the secondary offence.

Labeling theory has been criticized for not being able to answer the question of what causes primary deviance in the first place. The labeling of certain activities as deviant is not completely arbitrary. For example, it is not being labeled that leads some children from deprived backgrounds to steal from shops in the first place, but the backgrounds from which they come.

(4) **legalizing drugs:**

By legalizing drug use, we can:

a)remove the immense profits drugs now pump into the criminal underworld and eliminate all drug-related crimes, and hence solve the drug enforcement problem.
b)Take away the criminal stigma that prevents many addicts from seeking medical help
c)Reduce the forbidden–fruit attraction drugs have for young people
d)Could even tax the sale of now-illegal drugs and use the money to build more treatment center to help addicts to kick their addiction

**Illegalizing drugs:**

a)Legalization of drugs will surely increase drug use, because it gives a social sanction, and makes drugs available without risk, and at a low price.
b)With legalization, drug-related social costs will increase, including: drug-induced diseases, drug-related traffic accidents and broken homes.

(5)The term &quot;victimless crime&quot; is misleading. How victimless is a crime when young people steal to support a drug habit? What about a young pregnant woman who, by smoking crack, permanently harms her baby? Perhaps it is more correct to say that people who commit such crimes are both offenders and victims.

Another example: Is prostitution really victimless? The sex trade subjects many women to kidnapping, emotional abuse, and outright violence and also plays a part in spreading sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. In addition, many poor women –especially in low-income nations – become trapped in a life of selling sex. Thailand, for example, has as many as 2 million prostitutes, representing about 10 percent of all women in the labor force. About half of these women are teenagers – many begin working before they even reach their teens – and they typically suffer from physical and emotional abuse.

(6)Critics of labeling theory have argued that certain acts are universally and consistently prohibited across all societies, such as murder, rape and robbery. But this view is also criticized. Killing, for example, is not always regarded as murder. In times of war, killing the enemy is positively approved and rewarded. Until recently, the laws in Britain did not recognize as rape sexual intercourse forced on a woman by her husband, which also shows that labeling changes over time.

(7)basic assumptions:

Conservative explanations: Crime is sin and needs to be punished.

Liberal explanations: Crime is not really the fault of the criminal. It is only the adverse social conditions that force them into a criminal career.

Radical explanations: crime is socially created or defined.

White-collar crime may be defined as a crime committed by a person of high social status in the course of his occupation. White collars are more likely to commit an offence with skill, with sophistication, or most important, with the resources of power, influence, or respectability for avoid detection, prosecution, or conviction. The most common white-collar crimes are bank embezzlement, business fraud, bribery, and antitrust violations.

The only applicable perspective is the radical explanation (social-conflict theory).

According to social-conflict theory, laws and other cultural norms of a society are created directly by the rich and powerful, and criminality springs up only to the extent that a society treats its members unequally.Consequently, the laws against higher-status criminals are relatively lenient and less frequently enforced.

(8)Conservative explanations: use punishment as a deterrent for crime; not exactly effective; Liberal explanations: see the deeper social ills as the root cause of crime, advocating a slow fix, long-term solution, but not very effective, either; Radical explanations: use the idea of power structure to explain crime, effective in explaining some of the crimes but not all.

(9)The concept of deviance varies from culture to culture and changes over time. Within the samesociety,what was labeled as deviant act in the past may be widely accepted and officially approved.

Gay rights have been considered civil rights. The gay rights movement gained strength during the 1960s. one early mile-stone occurred in 1973, when the American Psychiatric Association declared that homosexuality was not an illness but simply &quot;a form of sexual behavior.&quot;In 2009, the APA declared that psychological therapy should not be used in an effort to make gay people straight. The gay rights movement also began using the term homophobia to describe discomfort over close personal interaction with people thought to be gay. The concept of homophobia turns the table on society: Instead of asking &quot;What&#39;s wrong with gay people?&quot; the question becomes &quot;What&#39;s wrong with people who can&#39;t accept a different sexual orientation?&quot;

Althoughmost religious traditions assert that homosexuality is morally wrong,American denominations support the civil and political rights of homosexual persons.

关于犯罪起因，我们以破碎家庭和破旧住宅区这个假说为例，这种解释似乎符合我们的常识性的世界观：贫困压力导致犯罪，但这种说法没有确切证据证实。并非每个离异家庭的孩子都成为罪犯；事实上，大多数这样的孩子都没有犯罪，在今天这个离婚已成为正常的、可接受的普通家庭一部分的时代，这种情况尤为明显。同样，说每个生活在一个贫穷的社区的人都是罪犯，也是不公平的；这些社区里也只是少数人犯罪，因此引起犯罪的不可能是贫穷本身而是其他一些因素。当我们意识到绝不是所有罪犯都是穷人或少数族裔时，这一点就更清楚了。中产阶级和贫困人群中都可见违法青年，联谊会上的富家子弟也常常恣意破坏公物，实施打架斗殴、强奸、盗窃以及所有其它形式的犯罪，尽管他们很少因为这些罪行被起诉。成年人中也一样，并非只有相对穷困的社会阶层犯罪，所谓的白领犯罪也是一个很严重的问题，涉及到开空头支票、挪用公款、企图贿赂政府官员或逃避法规等多种犯罪。

我们社会中男人的这种成长过程，几乎无一处能预示着婚姻的成功。我们自出生即加入的这个单独的世界标志着我们开启了错综复杂的人生之旅，在此过程中我们成为特定类型的人。我们的世界在几乎所有方面都与女性的世界背道而驰，我们和女性不单单在外表、谈吐、行为上有差异，就连我们的基本思维方式和生命取向都与她们形成鲜明对比，这种基本分歧对于女性来说很难领会，而当领会后常常极其疑惑，并在深入了解了我们如此不同的现实世界后感到反感。然而我们还必须和来自于那个特性相反世界的某个人永远结合，不仅要和她们共享生活空间，还必须融合我们的目标、希望、梦想和愿望，尽管我们与她们有本质上的差异。
